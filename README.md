Fix: Added langchain-community, uvicorn, dotenv, and other necessary packages

Bug: Version conflicts
Fix: Adjusted versions to be compatible

# Setup Instructions
## Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Groq API key (for Llama model)

## Installation
Clone the repository :
Install required packages:

 pip install -r requirements.txt

## Create a .env file with your API keys:

GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_api_key_here

## Create the data directory:
mkdir data

# Adding Sample Documents
Download a financial document (e.g., Tesla's quarterly report)
Save it as data/TSLA-Q2-2025-Update.pdf or upload via the API

# API Documentation

# Features
Document Processing: Upload and process PDF financial documents
Financial Analysis: AI-powered analysis of financial statements
Investment Recommendations: Data-driven investment suggestions
Risk Assessment: Evaluation of financial risks
Multi-Agent Architecture: Specialized agents for different analysis tasks

# Architecture
The system uses a multi-agent architecture with specialized roles:
Financial Analyst: Primary analysis of financial documents
Document Verifier: Validates document authenticity
Investment Advisor: Provides investment recommendations
Risk Assessor: Evaluates financial risks

# Important Notes
The current agent descriptions and task goals are intentionally humorous but should be updated for production use
The system uses Groq's Llama model for analysis, which requires a Groq API key
File uploads are temporarily stored and automatically cleaned up after processing
For production use, consider adding:
Authentication and authorization
Rate limiting
Proper error logging
Database storage for analysis results
More robust PDF parsing

# Limitations
Currently supports only PDF documents
Requires Groq API key for LLM functionality
Analysis quality depends on the clarity of the source document
The humorous agent descriptions need to be updated for professional use
